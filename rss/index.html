<h5 class="text-primary">What is Cloud Native Framework?</h5><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>A Cloud Native Framework is a set of technologies and tools that are specifically designed for building and running applications in a cloud-based environment. These frameworks are built to work with containerized applications, making it easier for developers to manage and deploy their applications on a cloud-based infrastructure.<br><br>One of the key features of Cloud Native Frameworks is their ability to automate the deployment process. This automation streamlines the development process, allowing developers to focus on creating high-quality applications rather than worrying about deployment and infrastructure management.<br><br>Cloud Native Frameworks also make it easier for developers to build applications that are scalable and reliable. These frameworks are designed to work with microservices, allowing developers to break down complex applications into smaller, more manageable components. This approach makes it easier to scale applications as needed, and also makes it easier to isolate and fix issues when they arise.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></div>
